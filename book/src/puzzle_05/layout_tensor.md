# LayoutTensor Version

## Overview

Implement a kernel that broadcast adds 1D LayoutTensor `a` and 1D LayoutTensor `b` and stores it in 2D LayoutTensor `out`.

**Note:** _You have more threads than positions._

## Key concepts

In this puzzle, you'll learn about:
- Using `LayoutTensor` for broadcast operations
- Working with different tensor shapes
- Handling 2D indexing with `LayoutTensor`

The key insight is that `LayoutTensor` allows natural broadcasting through different tensor shapes: \\((1, n)\\) and \\((n, 1)\\) to \\((n,n)\\), while still requiring bounds checking.

- **Tensor shapes**: Input vectors have shapes \\((1, n)\\) and \\((n, 1)\\)
- **Broadcasting**: Output combines both dimensions to \\((n,n)\\)
- **Guard condition**: Still need bounds checking for output size
- **Thread bounds**: More threads \\((3 \times 3)\\) than tensor elements \\((2 \times 2)\\)

<div class="solution-tips">

1. Get 2D indices: `row = thread_idx.y`, `col = thread_idx.x`
2. Add guard: `if row < size and col < size`
3. Inside guard: think about how to broadcast values of `a` and `b` as LayoutTensors

## Running the code

To test your solution, run the following command in your terminal:

<div class="code-tabs" data-tab-group="package-manager">
  <div class="tab-buttons">
    <button class="tab-button">uv</button>
    <button class="tab-button">pixi</button>
  </div>
  <div class="tab-content">

```bash
uv run poe p05_layout_tensor
```

  </div>
  <div class="tab-content">

```bash
pixi run p05_layout_tensor
```

  </div>
</div>

Your output will look like this if the puzzle isn't solved yet:
```txt
out: HostBuffer([0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0])
expected: HostBuffer([0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.0])
```

This solution demonstrates key concepts of LayoutTensor broadcasting and GPU thread mapping:

1. **Thread to matrix mapping**

   - Uses `thread_idx.y` for row access and `thread_idx.x` for column access
   - Natural 2D indexing matches the output matrix structure
   - Excess threads (3Ã—3 grid) are handled by bounds checking

2. **Broadcasting mechanics**
   - Input `a` has shape `(1,n)`: `a[0,col]` broadcasts across rows
   - Input `b` has shape `(n,1)`: `b[row,0]` broadcasts across columns
   - Output has shape `(n,n)`: Each element is sum of corresponding broadcasts
   ```txt
   [ a0 a1 ]  +  [ b0 ]  =  [ a0+b0  a1+b0 ]
                 [ b1 ]     [ a0+b1  a1+b1 ]
   ```

3. **Bounds Checking**
   - Guard condition `row < size and col < size` prevents out-of-bounds access
   - Handles both matrix bounds and excess threads efficiently
   - No need for separate checks for `a` and `b` due to broadcasting

This pattern forms the foundation for more complex tensor operations we'll explore in later puzzles.
