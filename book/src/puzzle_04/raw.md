## Overview
Implement a kernel that adds 10 to each position of 2D square matrix `a` and stores it in 2D square matrix `out`.

**Note:** _You have more threads than positions_.

## Key concepts

In this puzzle, you'll learn about:
- Working with 2D thread indices (`thread_idx.x`, `thread_idx.y`)
- Converting 2D coordinates to 1D memory indices
- Handling boundary checks in two dimensions

The key insight is understanding how to map from 2D thread coordinates \\((i,j)\\) to elements in a row-major matrix of size \\(n \times n\\), while ensuring thread indices are within bounds.

- **2D indexing**: Each thread has a unique \\((i,j)\\) position
- **Memory layout**: Row-major ordering maps 2D to 1D memory
- **Guard condition**: Need bounds checking in both dimensions
- **Thread bounds**: More threads \\((3 \times 3)\\) than matrix elements \\((2 \times 2)\\)

<div class="solution-tips">

1. Get 2D indices: `row = thread_idx.y`, `col = thread_idx.x`
2. Add guard: `if row < size and col < size`
3. Inside guard add 10 in row-major way!

## Running the code

To test your solution, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
magic run p04
```

Your output will look like this if the puzzle isn't solved yet:
```txt
out: HostBuffer([0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0])
expected: HostBuffer([10.0, 11.0, 12.0, 13.0])
```

This solution:
1. Get 2D indices:  `row = thread_idx.y`, `col = thread_idx.x`
2. Add guard: `if row < size and col < size`
3. Inside guard: `out[row * size + col] = a[row * size + col] + 10.0`
