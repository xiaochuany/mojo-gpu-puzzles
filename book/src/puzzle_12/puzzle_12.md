# Puzzle 12: Prefix Sum

## Overview
Prefix sum (also known as _scan_) is a fundamental parallel algorithm that computes running totals of a sequence. Found at the heart of many parallel applications - from sorting algorithms to scientific simulations - it transforms a sequence of numbers into their running totals. While simple to compute sequentially, making this efficient on a GPU requires clever parallel thinking!

Implement a kernel that computes a prefix-sum over 1D LayoutTensor `a` and stores it in 1D LayoutTensor `out`.

**Note:** _If the size of `a` is greater than the block size, only store the sum of each block._

## Key concepts

In this puzzle, you'll learn about:
- Parallel algorithms with logarithmic complexity
- Shared memory coordination patterns
- Multi-phase computation strategies

The key insight is understanding how to transform a sequential operation into an efficient parallel algorithm using shared memory.

For example, given an input sequence \\([3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9]\\), the prefix sum would produce:
- \\([3]\\) (just the first element)
- \\([3, 4]\\) (3 + 1)
- \\([3, 4, 8]\\) (previous sum + 4)
- \\([3, 4, 8, 9]\\) (previous sum + 1)
- \\([3, 4, 8, 9, 14]\\) (previous sum + 5)
- \\([3, 4, 8, 9, 14, 23]\\) (previous sum + 9)

Mathematically, for a sequence \\([x_0, x_1, ..., x_n]\\), the prefix sum produces:
\\[ [x_0, x_0+x_1, x_0+x_1+x_2, ..., \sum_{i=0}^n x_i] \\]

While a sequential algorithm would need \\(O(n)\\) steps, our parallel approach will use a clever two-phase algorithm that completes in \\(O(\log n)\\) steps! Here's a visualization of this process:

This puzzle is split into two parts to help you master the concept:

- [Simple Version](./simple.md)
  Start with a single block implementation where all data fits in shared memory. This helps understand the core parallel algorithm.

- [Complete Version](./complete.md)
  Then tackle the more challenging case of handling larger arrays that span multiple blocks, requiring coordination between blocks.

Each version builds on the previous one, helping you develop a deep understanding of parallel prefix sum computation. The simple version establishes the fundamental algorithm, while the complete version shows how to scale it to larger datasets - a common requirement in real-world GPU applications.
