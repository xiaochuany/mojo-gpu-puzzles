## Overview

Implement a kernel that computes the dot-product of 1D LayoutTensor `a` and 1D LayoutTensor `b` and stores it in 1D LayoutTensor `out` (single number).

**Note:** _You have 1 thread per position. You only need 2 global reads and 1 global write per thread._

## Key concepts

In this puzzle, you'll learn about:
- Similar to the [puzzle 8](../puzzle_08/layout_tensor.md) and [puzzle 9](../puzzle_09/layout_tensor.md), implementing parallel reduction with LayoutTensor
- Managing shared memory using `LayoutTensorBuilder`
- Coordinating threads for collective operations
- Using layout-aware tensor operations

The key insight is how LayoutTensor simplifies memory management while maintaining efficient parallel reduction patterns.

## Configuration

- Vector size: `SIZE = 8` elements
- Threads per block: `TPB = 8`
- Number of blocks: 1
- Output size: 1 element
- Shared memory: `TPB` elements

Notes:
- **Tensor builder**: Use `LayoutTensorBuilder[dtype]().row_major[TPB]().shared().alloc()`
- **Element access**: Natural indexing with bounds checking
- **Layout handling**: Separate layouts for input and output
- **Thread coordination**: Same synchronization patterns with `barrier()`

1. Create shared memory with tensor builder
2. Store `a[global_i] * b[global_i]` in `shared[local_i]`
3. Use parallel reduction pattern with `barrier()`

## Running the code

To test your solution, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
magic run p10_layout_tensor
```

Your output will look like this if the puzzle isn't solved yet:
```txt
out: HostBuffer([0.0])
expected: HostBuffer([140.0])
```

The solution implements a parallel reduction for dot product using LayoutTensor. Here's the detailed breakdown:

### Phase 1: Element-wise Multiplication
Each thread performs one multiplication with natural indexing:
```mojo
shared[local_i] = a[global_i] * b[global_i]
```

### Phase 2: Parallel Reduction
Tree-based reduction with layout-aware operations:

```txt
Initial:  [0*0  1*1  2*2  3*3  4*4  5*5  6*6  7*7]
        = [0    1    4    9    16   25   36   49]

Step 1:   [0+16 1+25 4+36 9+49  16   25   36   49]
        = [16   26   40   58   16   25   36   49]

Step 2:   [16+40 26+58 40   58   16   25   36   49]
        = [56   84   40   58   16   25   36   49]

Step 3:   [56+84  84   40   58   16   25   36   49]
        = [140   84   40   58   16   25   36   49]
```

### Key Implementation Features:

1. **Memory Management**:
   - Clean shared memory allocation with tensor builder
   - Type-safe operations with LayoutTensor
   - Automatic bounds checking
   - Layout-aware indexing

2. **Thread Synchronization**:
   - `barrier()` after initial multiplication
   - `barrier()` between reduction steps
   - Safe thread coordination

3. **Reduction Logic**:
   ```mojo
   stride = TPB // 2
   while stride > 0:
       if local_i < stride:
           shared[local_i] += shared[local_i + stride]
       barrier()
       stride //= 2
   ```

4. **Performance Benefits**:
   - \\(O(\log n)\\) time complexity
   - Coalesced memory access
   - Minimal thread divergence
   - Efficient shared memory usage

The LayoutTensor version maintains the same efficient parallel reduction while providing:
- Better type safety
- Cleaner memory management
- Layout awareness
- Natural indexing syntax

### Barrier Synchronization Importance

The `barrier()` between reduction steps is critical for correctness. Here's why:

Without `barrier()`, race conditions occur:

```text
Initial shared memory: [0 1 4 9 16 25 36 49]

Step 1 (stride = 4):
Thread 0 reads: shared[0] = 0, shared[4] = 16
Thread 1 reads: shared[1] = 1, shared[5] = 25
Thread 2 reads: shared[2] = 4, shared[6] = 36
Thread 3 reads: shared[3] = 9, shared[7] = 49

Without barrier:
- Thread 0 writes: shared[0] = 0 + 16 = 16
- Thread 1 starts next step (stride = 2) before Thread 0 finishes
  and reads old value shared[0] = 0 instead of 16!
```

With `barrier()`:
```text
Step 1 (stride = 4):
All threads write their sums:
[16 26 40 58 16 25 36 49]
barrier() ensures ALL threads see these values

Step 2 (stride = 2):
Now threads safely read the updated values:
Thread 0: shared[0] = 16 + 40 = 56
Thread 1: shared[1] = 26 + 58 = 84
```

The `barrier()` ensures:
1. All writes from current step complete
2. All threads see updated values
3. No thread starts next iteration early
4. Consistent shared memory state

Without these synchronization points, we could get:
- Memory race conditions
- Threads reading stale values
- Non-deterministic results
- Incorrect final sum
