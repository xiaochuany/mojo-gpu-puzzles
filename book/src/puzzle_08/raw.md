## Overview

Implement a kernel that adds 10 to each position of a vector `a` and stores it in `out`.

**Note:** _You have fewer threads per block than the size of `a`._

## Key concepts

In this puzzle, you'll learn about:
- Using shared memory within thread blocks
- Synchronizing threads with barriers
- Managing block-local data storage

The key insight is understanding how shared memory provides fast, block-local storage that all threads in a block can access, requiring careful coordination between threads.

## Configuration

- Array size: `SIZE = 8` elements
- Threads per block: `TPB = 4`
- Number of blocks: 2
- Shared memory: `TPB` elements per block

Notes:

- **Shared memory**: Fast storage shared by threads in a block
- **Thread sync**: Coordination using `barrier()`
- **Memory scope**: Shared memory only visible within block
- **Access pattern**: Local vs global indexing

> **Warning**: Each block can only have a *constant* amount of shared memory that threads in that block can read and write to. This needs to be a literal python constant, not a variable. After writing to shared memory you need to call [barrier](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/stdlib/gpu/sync/barrier/) to ensure that threads do not cross.

<div class="solution-tips">

1. Wait for shared memory load with `barrier()`
2. Use `local_i` to access shared memory: `shared[local_i]`
3. Use `global_i` for output: `out[global_i]`
4. Add guard: `if global_i < size`

## Running the code

To test your solution, run the following command in your terminal:

<div class="code-tabs" data-tab-group="package-manager">
  <div class="tab-buttons">
    <button class="tab-button">uv</button>
    <button class="tab-button">pixi</button>
  </div>
  <div class="tab-content">

```bash
uv run poe p08
```

  </div>
  <div class="tab-content">

```bash
pixi run p08
```

  </div>
</div>

Your output will look like this if the puzzle isn't solved yet:
```txt
out: HostBuffer([0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0])
expected: HostBuffer([11.0, 11.0, 11.0, 11.0, 11.0, 11.0, 11.0, 11.0])
```

<div class="solution-explanation">

This solution demonstrates key concepts of shared memory usage in GPU programming:

1. **Memory hierarchy**
   - Global memory: `a` and `out` arrays (slow, visible to all blocks)
   - Shared memory: `shared` array (fast, thread-block local)
   - Example for 8 elements with 4 threads per block:
     ```txt
     Global array a: [1 1 1 1 | 1 1 1 1]  # Input: all ones

     Block (0):      Block (1):
     shared[0..3]    shared[0..3]
     [1 1 1 1]       [1 1 1 1]
     ```

2. **Thread coordination**
   - Load phase:
     ```txt
     Thread 0: shared[0] = a[0]=1    Thread 2: shared[2] = a[2]=1
     Thread 1: shared[1] = a[1]=1    Thread 3: shared[3] = a[3]=1
     barrier()    ↓         ↓        ↓         ↓   # Wait for all loads
     ```
   - Process phase: Each thread adds 10 to its shared memory value
   - Result: `out[i] = shared[local_i] + 10 = 11`

3. **Index mapping**
   - Global index: `block_dim.x * block_idx.x + thread_idx.x`
     ```txt
     Block 0 output: [11 11 11 11]
     Block 1 output: [11 11 11 11]
     ```
   - Local index: `thread_idx.x` for shared memory access
     ```txt
     Both blocks process: 1 + 10 = 11
     ```

4. **Memory access pattern**
   - Load: Global → Shared (coalesced reads of 1s)
   - Sync: `barrier()` ensures all loads complete
   - Process: Add 10 to shared values
   - Store: Write 11s back to global memory

This pattern shows how to use shared memory to optimize data access while maintaining thread coordination within blocks.
